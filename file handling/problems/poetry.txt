 the black oaks
 fling their bronze fruit
 into all the pockets of the earth
 pock pock
 they knock against the thresholds
 the roof the sidewalk
 fill the eaves
 the bottom line
 of the old gold song
 of the almost finished year
 what is spring all that tender
 green stuff
 compared to this
 falling of tiny oak trees
 out of the oak trees
 then the clouds
 gathering thick along the west
 then advancing
 then closing over
 breaking open
 the silence
 then the rain
 dashing its silver seeds
 against the house
